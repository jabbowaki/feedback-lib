### What is this?
This is a riff off of Madlibs, except with the intent of giving feedback. You don't need to be mad to use this.

### Why did you build this?
Giving feedback is hard, and something I've seen is people writing verbose paragraphs to get a small point across. We've all been there.

The hope for this tool is to quickly create a template for your feedback. It might not say exactly what you need it to say, but it'll give you a base that you can build off of quickly.
